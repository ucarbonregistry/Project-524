Village : Samej

The project activity in Kullu district and the nearest big town is Rampur at a distance of 30 kms. The
projects are accessible by National Highway (NH)-22 which runs from Shimla to Tibet. The nearest
town is Shimla. Kalka is the major railway station and is about 80 Kms from Shimla. Kalka is about
300 kilometers from New Delhi, the capital city of India. 

Geographical location of the project activity
is 31°32’00” N and 76°02’30” E.
_______________
The main purpose of the project activity is to generate hydropower and export the net electricity to
the grid for sale resulting in reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in atmosphere, which could
have occurred otherwise, from the regional grid. The project activity is run of river Small
Hydroelectric Project (SHP) of 4.5 MW installed capacity developed at Sechi khad (stream) in
Samej village of Himachal Pradesh. The 4.5 MW Sechi SHP comprise of two units of 2.25 MW with
an annual average generation of 22.885 GWh. The generated electricity after auxiliary
consumption shall be exported to Himachal Pradesh State Electricity Board (HPSEB) grid for sale.

The connection point with the grid for Sechi SHP, is Jhakri Substation, which is at a distance of 4.5
kilometres from the project site. The project activity converts the potential energy available in water
flows to mechanical energy using turbines which drives generators to generate electricity. Sechi
Khads (streams) is a tributary of Sutlej River and the SHP is located along the streams.

Brief description of the installed technology and equipment:
The project installs two units of 2.25 MW Horizontal Francis turbine coupled with synchronous
generator. Water from the streams is diverted using a trench weir. The trench shall be below the
bed level with a width of 2.0 m and a depth uniformly varying from 1.8 m to 3.3 m at the intake
structure. A trash rack grill is provided on top of the trench opening, sloped in flow direction to
prevent settling of stones and pebbles and to facilitate them rolling away with the stream flow. The
water from the intake structure flows to a desilting chamber. Desilting chamber is provided to
exclude particle sizes exceeding 0.25 mm. The removal of silt is affected through a reduction in
flow velocity by increasing the flow area. The settled silt is removed by a flushing arrangement and
clear water flows from the top. The water conductor system takes the water to the forebay. The
water from the forebay is taken to the power house through a penstock. A single steel penstock
aligned on the hill slope shall be provided to lead the flow to the power house.
